Overview of Katie's idea for the matching algorithm:
• Iterate randomly through the set of students who do not have full schedules
• At each one, check their highest preference (do we remove preferences that have been 
filled/not fulfilled?), and attempt to assign the student to that subject in one of the 
student's open time slots
• If the student has no preferences left, remove them from the list/set and put them in 
another ArrayList (to iterate through to assign them randomly once there are no students 
left with preferences)
• INTERAL SWAP: If all the sessions of that subject during the student's open time slots 
are full, aka the addAssignment failed, check to see if there are any spots for that 
subject open during times that the student is full during, and if there are then check to 
see if the subject the student is taking already at that time has open spots during one of 
the student's other open time slots, and if it does then remove the assignment of the 
subject at the time with the other subject being available and add the assignment for the 
for that subject at another one of the student's open slots and add the assignment of the 
other subject at the original time slot; if this cannot happen, then the student's next 
preference is now trying to be fulfilled before going on to the next student
• EXTERNAL SWAP: Once we start assigning students randomly once there are no preferences 
left, we iterate through the students left who have open slots and no preferences and 
at each student go through each empty time slot and go through the classes and find one
with an open spot and assign the student to it; if a student ends up having only a 
subject/subjects that they are already in available to them during their open time slot 
trying to be filled, then go through the other students and check if they are taking a 
subject then that the student hasn't already taken and check if the donor student hasn't 
already taken the open subject/subjects during that time, and if the swap works then make 
the swap and if not then go on to the other students
